## How to file issues and get help

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or
feature request as a new Issue.

Moreover, be aware that some issues should be filed at [the repository of the tool itself](https://github.com/Koen1999/suricata-check) instead of at the repository of the Visual Studio Code extension depending on the nature of the issue.

For help and questions about using this project, please use the GitHub Discussions.
